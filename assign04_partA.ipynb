    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will write some Python statements within this Jupyter Notebook that are answers to the posed programming questions. By saving what you have written into the notebook, and submitting the resulting IPython file via conneX, the teaching team will be able to evaluate your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged to create your own notebooks in order to experiment with programming ideas. Once you have solutions that you wish to submit, they can be copy-and-pasted into this notebook. You should, however, always ensure your Python statements do work by evaluating them within this notebook.\n",

    "### Looking up championship winners\n",
    "\n",
    "This first part of the assignment will take you to the Ireland where they play the sport of **hurling** (links: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurling), [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BVIlpPy8Yc)). Many folks in that country are *very* passionate about the game, and each year a highlight of the sporting season is the **All-Ireland Finals**. Consider it a bit like \"Stanley Cup\" of hurling. You will write a function to help look up winners of the finals.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below is a list of tuples, where each tuple is of the form ```(year, province, county)``` or ```(int, str, str)```. The data contained in the list is of All-Ireland Finals winners since 1887. (The data was obtained from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_All-Ireland_Senior_Hurling_Championship_winners)).\n",

    "If you use shift-enter within that cell, the list will become part of this notebook's variable definitions and will afterards be accessible in any other code cell."
