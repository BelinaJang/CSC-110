    "\n",
    "According to Alberta Health Services, their ***Nutrition Guideline: Adult Weight Management*** suggest one way to target a 5% to 10% weight loss over six months is to reduce weight about around 0.5 kg to 1 kg per week. One way to achieve this weight-loss rate is to eat 500 to 1000 calories less than current intake. Also assumed here is that the person seeking to lose weight will modify their physical activity and also their behavior. (Here is a link to the posted Nutrition Guideline: https://bit.ly/2RMAG1d).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part you will obtain from the user a value for their current weight (provided in kilograms). If you then assume they will eat less as described above, and that their weight loss in in the middle of the range (i.e., 0.75 kg lost per week), then print a chart showing the projected weight at each week for 24 weeks. The table should we properly formatted (i.e., column aligned) therefore make good use of the **format()** function. (And remember what you have been taught in class about magic numbers!). And you can assume that any initial weight provided by the user will never be negative.\n",
