    "### Important Note\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first part (part A) of a two-part assignment. The second part (part B) is in the file named ```assign05_b.ipynb```.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will write some Python statements within this Jupyter Notebook that are answers to the posed programming questions. By saving what you have written into the notebook, and submitting the resulting IPython file via conneX, the teaching team will be able to evaluate your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged to create your own notebooks in order to experiment with programming ideas. Once you have solutions that you wish to submit, they can be copy-and-pasted into this notebook. You should, however, always ensure your Python statements do work by evaluating them within this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computing summary stock-price information\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lectures about lists we have seen some Python code examples that involve the processing of lists containing daily data (*i.e.*, weather). In this assignment we will also look at daily data, but instead of weather we will look at stock-trading information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code cell below are:\n",
    "* two global variables each corresponding to a list of strings, named ```STOCKDATA_LIST_01``` and ```STOCKDATA_LIST_02```. Each list contains the comma-separated values for a single month's data for a particular stock (in this case the `01` list is for Telus trading data of June 2019, and the `02` list is for Loblaws trading data of December 2019);\n",
    "* a nearly empty function called ```compute_month_stats()``` which you are to complete for this part of the assignment; and\n",
    "* a ```main()``` function that calls ```compute_month_stats()```.\n",
    "\n",
    "The docstring comment for ```compute_month_stats()``` describes the format of each string, and also describes what the function must compute. Note that the function which you are to complete ***must not produce output to the console*** (*i.e.*, must not call ```print()```). If the function is correctly written, the output of the program when ```STOCKDATA_LIST_01``` is given as the argument to the function will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "2019,06,51.22,47.77,23572300,1178615,8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and for `STOCKDATA_LIST_02` will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "2019,12,72.75,66.62,9564200,478210,10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of your solution you will need to use string-to-list functions such as ```split()```, as well as ```for``` loops and various kinds of ```if``` statements (and many other kinds of Python elements, too). You may use code from lecture slides but you **must** include a comment indicating which slides were used.\n",
    "\n",
    "And here are some additional important notes:\n",
    "1. Please remember that strings are not integers or floats. You may need to call ```int()```, ```float()```, and ```str()``` as appropriate.\n",
    "1. ***You are permitted to ```import``` only the ```math``` modules into your solution.* That is, may *not* use ```re```, ```pandas```, ```itertools```, etc.).**"
