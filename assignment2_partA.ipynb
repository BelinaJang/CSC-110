    "### Part A: Roman numerals\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part of this assignment you will play around with converting some integers into Roman numerals (for more on these go to  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your program will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prompt the user for a one number (integer) from 1 up to and including 20.\n",
    "1. If the number it outside this range (i.e., a negative number, or a number greater than 20), then the program will display an error message and stop.\n",
    "1. Otherwise the program will construct and print the Roman-numeral equivalent of the number provided by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "The roman numerals from 1 to 10 are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X\n",
    "\n",
    "and from 11 to 20 are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV, XVI, XVII, XVIII, XIX, X\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the numbers from 11 to 20 are just \"X\" followed by the equivalent roman numerals when the number has ten subtracted from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your solution must make use of some combination of **if** statements, **if-else** statements, nested decision structures and **if-elif-else** statements (although you are not strictly required to use every one of the conditional-instruction forms just listed). For those who already know how to use lists and dictionary, you are **not** to use these in your solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "And some further notes on writing a solution:\n",
    "* Better solutions (i.e., ones getting more marks) will avoid answering the question in one big **if-elif-else** having 20 or so blocks.\n",
    "* You can take advantage of using temporary variables of your own choosing, such as subtracting or adding from the value provided by the user.\n",
    "* You can build the resulting Roman number step by step, adding a letter in one conditional statement, adding another letter (or letters) in another conditional statement.\n",
    "* Don't forget that you can use multiplication on strings, e.g., **\"-\" * 3** is the same as **---**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a transcript of a session where the user asks for the roman-numeral equivalent of 18.\n",
    "\n",

    "What is the number to covert (from 1 to 20)? 18\n",
