    "### Part B: Interest calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "Many investments instruments provided by banks, such as Guaranteed Investment Certificates (GICs) pay interest not only on the initial investment (the *principal*) but also on the interest that accumulates over time (*compound* interest).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us suppose you have been asked by Sam, your friend working at the Happy Coder Credit Union (HCCU), to help clients calculate investment returns on their GICs. That is, clients want to know what their final investment balance will be if they:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Purchase a GIC at a specific interest rate**; and then\n",
    "1. **Let their GIC earn compound interest for a certain number of years.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for calculating the balance of such an investment after a specified number of years is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A = P (1 + \\frac{r}{n})^{nt}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $A$ is the amount of money in the account after the specific number of years.\n",
    "* $P$ is the principal amount that was originally deposited into the account.\n",
    "* $r$ is the **annual** interest rate.\n",
    "* $n$ is the number of times per year that the interest is compounded\n",
    "* $t$ is the specific number of years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program that makes the calculation for you. The program should ask the user to input the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The amount of principal originally deposited into the GIC\n",
    "1. The annual interest rate paid by the GIC\n",
    "1. The number of times per year that interest is compounded (e.g., if interest is compounded monthly, enter 12; if interest is compounded quarterly, enter 4)\n",
    "1. The number of years the GIC will be left to earn investment interest\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the input data has been entered, the program must calculate and display the amount of money that will be in the account after the specific number of years. **The user must enter the interest rate as a percentage, but without the '%' sign. That is, 2% would be entered as 2 and not as 0.02. Therefore your program will have to divide the input by 100 to move the decimal point to the correct position.** The value that is output must be printed with two decimal points; during lectures I will give some description of how output can be formatted in this way.\n"
