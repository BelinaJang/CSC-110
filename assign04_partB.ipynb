By saving what you have written into the notebook, and submitting the resulting IPython file via conneX, the teaching team will be able to evaluate your work.\n",

    "You are encouraged to create your own notebooks in order to experiment with programming ideas. Once you have solutions that you wish to submit, they can be copy-and-pasted into this notebook.
